### Welcome to my Profile!

I am an edtech (education technology) sysadmin of ~7 years, managing Cisco networks and Windows infrastructure. While most of my professional skills are focused on the Windows side of things, I have also dabbled in a fair bit of Linux via my homelab and more recently following the [chrultrabook](https://github.com/chrultrabook) project.

I'm not much of a programmer, but in the past, I have worked in Python, Node, and recently Deno. I hope to find more opportunities to further my programming skills at some point.
